# Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict future sales for a retail company by analyzing historical sales data. Accurate sales forecasting enables businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, budgeting, and strategic planning.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Historical Sales Data**: Identify patterns and trends in past sales.
- **Develop Predictive Models**: Utilize time series analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast future sales.
- **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the accuracy of different models to select the most reliable one.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Used**: ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost

## Dataset

The dataset comprises historical sales records, including features such as date, product category, sales volume, and price. [Include details about the data source and any preprocessing steps taken.]

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered historical sales data from company records.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized sales trends and seasonality.
4. **Model Development**: Built and tuned various predictive models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

## Results

The [selected model] achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [value], indicating a high level of accuracy in forecasting future sales.

## Conclusion

Implementing this sales forecasting model allows the company to anticipate demand more effectively, optimize inventory levels, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

## Future Work

- **Incorporate External Factors**: Include economic indicators, marketing campaigns, and competitor analysis to improve model accuracy.
- **Real-Time Forecasting**: Develop a system for continuous, real-time sales predictions.
